  #====# MYSQL INSTALLATION #=================================================#

    # GitHub Actions has a "Services" Method for Configuring mysql, e.g.
    #
    #     mysql:
    #       image: mysql:8.0
    #       env:
    #         MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
    #         MYSQL_DATABASE: test
    #
    # ...etc.  We don't use this method of configuring MySQL and making tables
    # as that is harder to copy/paste as equivalent in a local console.

    # ODBC does not like letting you use the root account w/no password as
    # a data source.  Make account `test` with password `test-password` and
    # give it access to the database.
    #
    # Note: GitHub CI sets the MySQL root account up with a password, but this
    # wasn't true on Travis...and might not be true on all systems.  Keep the
    # test account creation in case some cases need it.

    # The "DSN" identifying the database is "Rebol", a label stored in the
    # unixodbc %/usr/local/etc/odbc.ini (or similar).  But the actual name
    # of the MySQL database mapped to there is `test`.
    #
    # Use the test account with the test password to do this as a sanity
    # check that the privileges are granted.

    # Register that DSN.  The `odbc://rebol-mysql` syntax for naming a DSN
    # is Rebol-specific, typically it would just be `Rebol` in a context
    # that knows a DSN is supposed to be in that position.
    #
    # We don't set the UID or PWD here on Linux even though it is allowed,
    # because Windows does not allow it.  It must be in the connection string.
    #
    # NOTE: if you have problems with `localhost` saying can't connect with
    # socket /tmp/mysql.sock, and you are sure the mysql daemon is running,
    # then on some Linux installations using `127.0.0.1` instead can help
    # force not to go through a socket.  That doesn't solve the problem if
    # you actually want to talk to a database over a network, but is good
    # enough for this test (and other purposes).

    # The tests are designed to call QUIT and return 1 status on failure, with

    # The goal is to store Rebol values into column types that can hold them,
    # and then read the same value back out after writing it.

    # This runs against the DSNs of the MySQL database created above.
