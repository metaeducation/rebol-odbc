    Title: "ODBC Test Script"
    Description: {
        This script does some basic table creation, assuming you have
        configured an ODBC connection that has a "test" database inside it.
        Then it queries to make sure it can get the data back out.

        Due to variations in SQL implementations (as well as some variance
        in what you need to do to configure ODBC), it's very difficult to
        write a single generic "test script" does anything complex.  But
        this shows some coverage of fundamental ODBC operation; since it
        just passes through the query strings as-is, really this is most of
        what an interface has to handle.

        Use: r3 test-odbc.reb dsn --firebird --show-sql
    }
    Notes: {
      * This test supports Firebird even though it is non-standard, because
        prominent user @gchiu has used it for decades, including in the
        Synapse EHR product.  Here is a summary of its quirky mappings; we
        assume support for versions >= 3.0 only:

        https://firebirdsql.org/manual/migration-mssql-data-types.html

      * Some databases (notably MySQL and SQLite) allow backticks when
        naming tables or columns, and use double-quotes to annotate string
        values.  This is not standard SQL, which conflates double quotes for
        string literals as the means for avoiding conflicts with reserved
        column names:

        https://stackoverflow.com/q/5952677

        But because MySQL will error if you put column or table names in
        double quotes--and databases like Firebird will error if you use
        backticks--there's no common way to use a reserved word as a column
        name.  That means not just columns with names like `INT`, but even
        useful-sounding names like `VALUE`.

        This file sticks to a lowest-common denominator of naming without
        quotes, rather than do conditional delimiting based on ODBC source.
