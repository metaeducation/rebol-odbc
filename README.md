## ODBC Extension

ODBC is an abstraction layer for communicating with databases, originating
from Microsoft in the 1990s but commonly available on Linux and other
platforms as well:

Integration with ODBC was a commercial feature of Rebol2/Command:

  http://www.rebol.com/docs/database.html

Though it was not included in R3-Alpha, Christian Ensel published code to
interface with "hostkit" to provide some of the functionality:

  https://github.com/gurzgri/r3-odbc/

That code was taken as the starting point for developing an ODBC extension
against the modern "libRebol" API.  In November of 2023, it achieved the
goal of compiling solely against the external API, without access to any
internal structures or functions.

## Building

If you are using Windows, the ODBC headers are typically included by default
(e.g. in Visual Studio).

On Linux, you will need `unixodbc`, but specifically the development library.
The command on Debian to get these is:

    sudo apt install unixodbc-dev

On Mac, it seems HomeBrew will install the headers when you merely say:

    brew install unixodbc

## Notes

* ODBC Data Source Names (DSN) have a maximum length of 32 characters.  They
  can be ASCII characters except for spaces and [ ] { } , ; ? * = ! @ \

## License

same as the Rebol 3 Core.

## Future Directions

Right now if you build a Rebol with the ODBC extension statically, then that
Rebol will require the ODBC shared libraries or DLLs to be present on the
target machine to run.  It would be nice if this could be decoupled such that
if ODBC was not present, it would still be able to run Rebol.
